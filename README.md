# Self-Attention-GAN-SAGAN-for-CelebA-TensorFlow-Keras
A complete Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) implementation using TensorFlow 2.x and Keras, trained on the CelebA dataset to generate high-quality human face images. This project integrates self-attention mechanisms and spectral normalization to model long-range spatial dependencies and ensure stable GAN training.
